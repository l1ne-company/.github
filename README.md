# L1NE Company

**Cloud-Native. Without Kubernetes. Without Containers.**

At **L1NE**, we’re reimagining the foundation of modern infrastructure. We believe scalability, reliability, and velocity shouldn’t depend on complex orchestration layers or container sprawl.

That’s why we’re building a new cloud-native paradigm — one that runs entirely on **NixOS**, with no containers, no Kubernetes, and no vendor lock-in.

Our mission is to unify development and SRE in a single, declarative ecosystem — where reproducibility is built-in, scalability is predictable, and infrastructure behaves like code, not magic.

We empower teams to:

* Scale workloads predictably, without orchestration overhead.
* Operate production systems with full observability and reproducibility.
* Embrace failure-resilience and self-healing as core primitives.
* Treat infrastructure as deterministic, auditable, and version-controlled.

**From developer laptops to globally distributed systems, all with the same reproducible foundation.**

This is not an alternative to the cloud.

**It’s a reboot.**

**L1NE — Declarative. Scalable. Containerless.**
