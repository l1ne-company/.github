# **L1NE Company**

**Cloud-Native. Without Kubernetes. Without Containers.**

L1NE is an ecosystem for fully reproducible infrastructure — built entirely on **NixOS**, with no containers, no Kubernetes, and no vendor lock-in.

### **The L1NE Ecosystem**

* **one-for-all** — local CI/CD and caching backbone. Develop, build, and share reproducible systems from your laptop to the cloud.
* **l1ne** — a Kubernetes-like orchestrator for Nix. Declarative, self-healing, and production-ready — without orchestration complexity.

We unify development and SRE in a single declarative flow where scalability is predictable, failures are recoverable, and infrastructure behaves like code.

**L1NE — Declarative. Scalable. Containerless.**
